# FolderSystem
The FolderSystem program is designed to replicate/mock the file explorer/finder programs designed with Windows and MacOS repectively.

The program utilizes many components of data structures and algorithms (mainly sorting). The program utilizes linked lists, queues and arraylists to create custom folder and file objects in a hierarchical tree structure. 

# Functionality

- Create a file or folder in the user's current directory
- Delete files or folders by name 
- Importing and exporting the FolderSystem from and to a .txt file respectively
- Sorting files and folders alphabetically in the user's current directory
